This was only meant to be used for a YouTube video, but many people asked for a copy.

Sorry for the horrible code - it was originally made for my eyes only.

Also it doesn't seem to work on Windows 10. I guess GetWindowRect in user32.dll does not behave in the same way it does on Windows 7.

### Troubleshooting:
* Use Windows 7
* Open Bejeweled3.exe before running the program
* Resize your game window so the tiles are 50px in width
* If you want to play diamond mine, use the diamond-mine branch, otherwise master for classic mode. For any other mode, feel free to write it yourself :).
